    "## Biochemical reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple transcription-translation system the RNA of a certain gene is prodcued with a fixed rate $\\beta$ and decays with a rate proportional to the curren amount of RNA, a so called first order decay. The protein that our gene is coding for is produced with a rate that is proportional to the current amount of RNA and follows a first order decay as well. A reaction scheme of this small system looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\xrightarrow{k_{1}} RNA \\xrightarrow{d_{1}} o$$ $$RNA \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} protein$$ $$protein \\xrightarrow{d_{2}} o$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deterministic ODE system\n",
    "\n",
    "The above reaction scheme can be tranlated into two [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation). For the sake of simplicity we have assumed [mass action kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action) without any saturation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}RNA}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{1} - d_{1}\\cdot RNA$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}protein}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{2}\\cdot RNA - d_{2} \\cdot protein$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This system of equations describes the rule how the systems state given by the concentration of RNA and protein molecules changes given the current state. The left hand side of the equations are the rate of change and the right hand side the rule how the change depends on the current state. Note that the concentration of RNA appears in both equations, thus the equations are coupled as the amount of proteins depends on the amount of RNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly solve ODEs it is necessary to know the state of the system at one instant of time. Often refered to as the intial conditions and associated with time point $t = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed the transcription rate $\\beta$ to be constant over time. You can imagine this situation as if at time point zero a transcription factor binds the gene's promoter and activates transcription. For now we will investigate the temporal evolution of the RNA and protein assuming constant transcription, later we will consider the case when transcription is only transiently activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady state\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcription-translation reaches a steady state, i.e. RNA and protein concentrations that do not change over time because the respective production and decay processes balance each other. In steady state the left hand side of the differential equations equals zero and we are left with two algebraic equations that we can solve to calculate the steady state:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the algebraic equations for the steady state: $RNA_{ss}$ and $P_{ss}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RNA_{ss} = \\frac{k_{1}}{d_{1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{ss} = \\frac{k_{2}\\cdot RNA_{ss}}{d_{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{d_{1}d_{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The steady state is fully determined by the biochemical reaction rates of our system and here it is a stable state. This means if we move the system out of steady state it will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytic solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the ODE system with the intital condition $RNA_{0} = protein_{0} = 0$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{RNA}(t)= RNA_{ss}\\big( 1- e^{-d_{1} t}\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{protein}(t)= P_{ss}\\bigg(1 - \\frac{d_{1}e^{-d_{2}t} - d_{2}e^{-d_{2}t}}{d_{1} - d_{2}}\\bigg)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simple ODE system given here it is possible to obtain a analytical solution, in more complex situations this usually is not possible and it is necessary to numerically integrate differential equations. Although we could work here with the analytical solutions we want to go the numerical way. A first impression on how an algorithm could approximate a solution of an ODE gives [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)."

    "\n",
    "Circadian oscillations are our daily rhythms: activity, metabolism, sleep, etc. They are controlled by multiple genes that influence each other. The simple transcription-translation system that we were investigating so far is not able to create oscillations. For sustained oscillation we need negative feedback. This means that the protein acts back on its own transcription as a supressor. A second important ingredient to create oscillations is a time delay, thus, the feedback of the protein (here _Per1_) acts not instantaneous but with some delay. The protein _Per1_ exists in two forms here indicated as $protein$ and $protein_p$ which supresses its own transcription but first it has to be created which generates the delay. \n",

The feedback on the RNA prodiction is mediated by a special input function, a so called Hill-Function. A sigmoidal function, i.e. the effect of the feedback saturates and does not become arbitrarily large. The Hill-Coefficient $n$ describes the steepness of the Hill-Function. We will see during the investigation of the system that $n$ plays a cruicial role and that it has to pass a minimal threshold to obtain undampened oscillations.\n",

    "Biochemical interactions in single cells can be random. For instance, various transcription factors are present in cells only in hundreds to thousands of copies, which is not much considering the size of the genome and that each gene is usually present in two alleles only. Such low copy numbers can create strong stochastic effects on the single cell level. In this part of the lecture we want to briefly dig into its implications. We use a so called Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate stochastic realistations of our transcription-translation system. We will test the effects of different parameter values on temporal fluctuations."

    "## The stochastic simulation algorithm\n",

    "Developed mainly by Daniel Gillespie. The algorithm simulates the stochastic biochemical interactions of the reacting species, here RNA and protein, based on the current amount molecules of each species and the rates of the possible reactions. The algorithm essentially is a loop and in each iteration the next reaction that happens and the time point of the reaction are simulated based on random number generation. A deeper explanation of the algorithm can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) or in the original publications of [D. Gillespie](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100540a008). [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17037977) you can find a comprehensible review of the algorithm, it's foundations and possible approximate implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the deterministic ODE system above the amount of RNA and protein now is not measured in concentrations but in the number of molecules of each species. The systems state is defined by the set of molecule counts. During each iteration of the algorithm the systems state is update according to the sampled reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of four different reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RNA production:** $ RNA \\xrightarrow{\\beta} RNA + 1$\n",
    "2. **RNA decay:** $RNA \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_{m}\\cdot RNA} RNA - 1$\n",
    "3. **Protein production:** $protein \\xrightarrow{k\\cdot RNA} protein + 1$\n",
    "4. **Protein decay:** $protein \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_{p}\\cdot protein} protein - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood of each reaction depends of the current state of the system, i.e. the number of present RNA and protein molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **steady state** of the stochastic system is the same as for the deterministic ODE system. However, now we will observe fluctuations around the steady state. The characteristics of this fluctuations are controlled by the reaction rates. Time course measurements of fluctuations around the steady state allow to estimate the kinetic reaction rates which would not be for the ODE system."
